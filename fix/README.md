# CSM Installer Workarounds

This is a repository to keep track of all of the workarounds being used to bring up CSM until the proper fix/feature is merged.

## Current procedure

1.  Make sure there is a ticket for the workaround 
2.  Add is_workaround label to the ticket
3.  Create a directory in the proper directory where the workaround should be run.   If there isn't one that fits, create a new one.
4.  Create a README file with instructions on how to do the workaround
5.  Create scripts for as much as you can for the workaround and put those scripts in the directory 


## When workaround is no longer needed
1.  Remove the workaround directory from this repository
2.  Remove the is_workaround label from the ticket
