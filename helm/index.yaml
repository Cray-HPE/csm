# Packaging index for Helm charts not listed in Loftsman manifests. Format is:
#
#   <repo>:
#     charts:
#       <name>:
#       - <version>
#       - ...
#
# The ../release.sh script uses ../hack/gen-helm-index.sh to parse Helm charts
# specified in all Loftsman manifests under ../manifests and update this file.
# Therefore there is no need to list charts in this index that are already
# specified in a Loftsman manifest.
